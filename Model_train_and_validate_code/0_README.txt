= script for formulating the regression model for actual evapotranspiration, with the water balance ET as the predictand and precipitation, PET, soil moisture, maximum temperature, and (NDVI) as the predictors


FOLDER/S:

1. data
= contains the .csv files of the predictand and predictors for each of the seven watersheds; this will allow the user to proceed to model training and validation without running the prior scripts under data download and pre-process code
