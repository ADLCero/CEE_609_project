Repository for CEE 609: Environmental Data Science project, Fall 2022


## Research Questions:

1. How does the annual actual evapotranspiration (ET) calculated using the water balance approach compare to remotely-sensed evapotranspiration?
2. What are the trends in ET that are revealed by these data sets?
3. Is ET dependent on the following potential controls: 
    - precipitation;
    - atmospheric demand and energy availability (quantified through PET); and
    - vegetation activity (NDVI)?
