### Repository for CEE 609: Environmental Data Science project, Fall 2022

This project was created using [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).

All scripts are provided with instructions on which packages and libraries are necessary to be downloaded and used. These are also listed in the R_packages_libraries.txt file.

### Contents (Folders):

1. **Data_download_and_preprocess_code**: R scripts for downloading data
2. **Model_train_and_validate_code**: R script and data for formulating, fitting, and testing models for predicting evapotranspiration
3. **Figures_and_figure_code**: markdown file showing the process of creating figures of the data and results

Each folder has their corresponding "data" folder where the outputs are stored. Each also has a readme.txt file for the instructions on how to run the scripts. Scripts are arranged and have to be run according to their sequence.

# Analysis of potential controls on evapotranspiration across watersheds in eastern US

# Introduction

## Research Questions:

1. How does the annual actual evapotranspiration (ET) calculated using the water balance approach compare to remotely-sensed evapotranspiration?
2. What are the trends in ET that are revealed by these data sets?
3. Is ET dependent on the following potential controls: 
    - precipitation;
    - atmospheric demand and energy availability (quantified through PET);
    - soil moisture;
    - average monthly maximum temperature;
    - vegetation activity (NDVI)?
